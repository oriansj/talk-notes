title: Perfect reproducibility through cross-platform bootstrapping
Subtitle (if an option): An introduction to stage0 and mes.

Abstract:
Have you ever made yogurt? In order to make it, you first need to add yogurt to
milk. But what if you don't have yogurt to make yogurt? How do you bootstrap
yogurt?

We have a similar problem in software when trying to create reproducible builds.
How can you build (compile) if you don't have a builder (compiler)? How do you
bootstrap a reproducible build? This is the yogurt software problem.

The goal of reproducible builds is to increase trust that the binaries we produce
match the sources we use to build them. In this talk I will introduce the stage0
and mes projects, which are doing great work to support reproducible builds in
projects which use gcc by collaborating to bootstrap gcc from the barest of bones
up to a fully functional gcc compiler. By bootstrapping gcc, stage0 and mes are
working to solve the yogurt software problem.

By the end of this talk, audience members will know why reproducible builds
matter, how to support reproducible builds by contributing to stage0 and mes,
and where to get started with their contributions.
